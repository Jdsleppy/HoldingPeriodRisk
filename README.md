HoldingPeriodRisk
=================

Quick Monte-Carlo simulation of a risky asset held for 1, 5, or 20 years.

The purpose of this program is to evaluate how the holding period of a risky
asset, such as a stock mutual fund, with reinvestment of dividends affects
the risk (std deviation) of the annualized cumulative return (as defined in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return#Geometric_average_rate_of_return).
Monte-Carlo simulation is used to demonstrate that extended holding periods
indeed decrease the risk as measured by the annualized cumulative rate
(geometric average rate).
